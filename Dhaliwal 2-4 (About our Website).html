      <h2>Who am I as one person to be able to build this website?</h2>
        <p> In making this website, I believe it's also time to share our music taste to the whole world! It never hurts to try out something new, especially that I know for a fact that Ezekiel Miller himself may be famous in the Philippines, but I know for a fact that he deserves the recognition around the world, even getting recognized by other famous people like Eminem himself on what people think about him as he raps his vocals. He truly deserves it and that's why in this website, this explains some of the general or common questions about his playlists and on who Ezekiel Miller is. But it's always possible to share our favorites to the world, for we are built to listen to other musics that are lost under the deep treasure, which truly gives you a reward of gold music. I'm honored in making of this website, although with long hours of making this website and the sacrifices that I've made in making this simple yet elegant website, I hope for the best that this website inspires you that <strong>YOU</strong>, yes you, can do anything in giving your gratitude towards your favorite idols, whether they've pulled your strings, inspired you to become stronger, and many more!</p>
