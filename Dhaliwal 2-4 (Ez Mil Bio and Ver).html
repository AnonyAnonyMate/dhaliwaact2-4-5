      <h2>Who is Ez Mil anyways?</h2>
        <p> Ezekiel Miller Sapiera (born July 27, 1998), also known professionally as Ez Mil, is a Filipino-American rapper, singer, and songwriter currently signed under Virgin Music/MCA Music, Inc.

	    <summary> <h2> How and when did he get famous? </h2> </summary>
        <p> He himself was very famous when he released his "Panalo" music. Since then, it has been his main song for the Pinoy people inside of Generation Z, making him believe that he can be more than what he thought he would become. So he said to his fans, “Do y’all know what I’m singing next?” Up to this day, he's well-known for his famous playlists such as "Act 1", "Resonances", and with his latest playlist "DU4LI7Y", and it's all because of his inspiration from "Chris Brown" both for his music and dancing that started Ezekiel Miller's obsession of hip-hop, which also led him with Jabbawockeez, another one of his obsessions back in his childhood days. </p>
