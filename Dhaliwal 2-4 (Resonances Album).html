      <h2 id="patriotic3">What's even the meaning of the Resonances Album? Why do people love it?</h2>
        <p>Just like the basic definition of the word <strong>Resonance</strong>, meaning <em>the quality in a sound of being deep, full, and reverberating</em>, this song represents the feeling of gloominess and dark thoughts running in our nerves but in a richer and better way. This allows him to vent out his feelings while giving out the best and richest music that his fans wants! What a better way to vent out our feelings and also vibing into it while recharging our hope and faith! </p>

        <p> The musics being played here are played in a slow mannered tempo and being played mostly by the <mark> guitar</mark> because this gives off a smooth and base mannered tempo while playing his songs in a sad but inspiring way. Because of this, this playlist has been highly influencial by other people who needs the motivation too. Count that as being one singer and therapist along with it! </p>
