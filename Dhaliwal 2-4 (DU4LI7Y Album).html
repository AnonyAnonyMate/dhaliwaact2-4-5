		  <p> Did you know that this playlist was honored with Ez Mil's first DU4LI7Y MV (Music Video) on the day of his birthday? Sure, the playlist itself was released before his birthday which hyped the fanbase even more after he released songs such as <em>"Re-up"</em>, <em>"Dalawampu't Dalawa Oo"</em>, and <em>"27 Bodies"</em>, but the day where he truly reveals the DU4LI7Y album in the form of making its first MV for the song <em>"Ridin With the Moonlight"</em> is what truly made it different, since while the song was live, it was his birthday alongside, so the fans is even excited to hear his first DU4LI7Y MV while celebrating his birthday and honoring on what he did in stringing the fan's heart. What a true surprise, surely that'll be one memorable experience! </p>

      <h2>What has the DU4LI7Y album done to make it well-known? What does it signify? </h2>
        <p> Just like the Act 1 Album, the DU4LI7Y Album also gave the biggest hype in Ezekiel Miller's fanbase. This truly made him on who he actually is, and it's no surprise since he does truly deserve all the recognition for all the hardwork! Just like the Act 1 Album, this too continued its storyline, but this time, instead of making his sidekick <strong>Slashy</strong> be in one song, he finally picked him up in his hands and brought him alongside his journey in his DU4LI7Y album, and thus, we can see the skeleton mob being <strong> Slashy</strong> himself. Truly a pat on the back, a man who has made his lifelong icon character becoming part of his storyline!</p>

        <p> In this album, it doesn't have a separation of genre unlike his other 2 Albums, but rather, he <mark>combines both the genre of both albums and made his song on what he truly feels about himself</mark>. But, how does this album make it any different? If you look closely in some of his songs, he refers it to both himself and to the society. He deals problems that we're way too common in the society such as the separation of love of one another and so much more. Another thing is that he adds symbolism to some of his songs, such as in one of his songs like <em>Dalawampu't Dalawa Oo</em>, which shows the code <em>2200</em>, which means it's the zipcode of his birth country â€” Olongapo in Manila, Philippines. Now that's some determination for his birth country, and hands down and much respect to him! </p>
