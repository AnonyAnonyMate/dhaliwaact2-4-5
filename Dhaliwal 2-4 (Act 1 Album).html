This is also where Ez Mil starts explaining onto his songs for his soon-to-be loved one for his future like in his songs "1 and Only" and "Far Away From Home" and to his beloved mother like in his song "Easy-Going Millions".

        <p> Act 1 Album composes of slow rap, some romantic and sad songs, patriotic, and so many more of the songs were implemented! They're well-known for the Gen Z for it connects to many people's hearts! His impeccable singing and smooth vocals are what made this truly a life-changing story! This album is also a start to the story of a connection of songs that many can relate to like it's characters like Slashy from the song "The Slashy Show" as it's assistant in his everday life, which mainly pops in his QnA videos. What a cute but unforgettable character! </p>
